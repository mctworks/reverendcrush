You really don't want me anywhere near LinkedIn, despite my workaholism.</p> \r\n        <p>However, my buddy who coded a huge chunk of this webpage plus the BlueSky section on the front page, MCT630 (formerly mctworks) is somewhere on there. If you're looking for a web dev and like what you see here, he's the one to speak to. He's requested I not link directly to his LinkedIn, but it's on <a href=\"https://mct630.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his website</a>.</p>\r\n        <h2>SomethingAwful Forums!?!?!!?</h2>\r\n        <p><i>(no comment)</i></p>\r\n        </section>\r\n        <Link to='/'>HOME</Link>\r\n    </React.Fragment>\r\n    );   \r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Contact;"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,IAAIC,SAAS,QAAQ,OAAO;AACxC,SAAQC,IAAI,QAAO,kBAAkB;AACrC,OAAO,uBAAuB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE/B,SAASC,OAAOA,CAAA,EAAE;EAAAC,EAAA;EACdL,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;IACZ;IACAM,QAAQ,CAACC,IAAI,CAACC,SAAS,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,cAAc,CAAC;;IAE3C;IACA,OAAO,MAAM;MACTH,QAAQ,CAACC,IAAI,CAACC,SAAS,CAACE,MAAM,CAAC,cAAc,CAAC;IAClD,CAAC;EACL,CAAC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EAEN,oBACIP,OAAA,CAACJ,KAAK,CAACY,QAAQ;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACfT,OAAA;MAASU,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACjCT,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAY;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAqB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC9Bd,OAAA;QAAGU,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAACK,IAAI,EAAC,4CAA4C;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAACC,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;QAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;MAAkB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChId,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAwT;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC/Td,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACjBd,OAAA;QAAGU,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAACK,IAAI,EAAC,yCAAyC;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAACC,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;QAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;MAA+B;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1Id,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAoK;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAAAd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,GAAG,uCAAqC,eAAAT,OAAA;UAAGe,IAAI,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;UAACC,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAA0B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,kKAA4J,eAAAd,OAAA;UAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;QAAU;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,wVAAkV;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChzBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAY;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAggB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACvgBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAgI;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACvId,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAM;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACfd,OAAA;QAAGU,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAACK,IAAI,EAAC,kCAAkC;QAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;QAACC,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;QAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;MAAa;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACjHd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAyP;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChQd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,GAAI,KAAG,eAAAT,OAAA;UAAMU,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;QAAC;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpDd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAkc;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzcd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAgB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACtBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAS;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAA4O;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACnPd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACjBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAoI;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC3Id,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAAS;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAClBd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;MAAub;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9bd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,GAAG,+SAA6S,eAAAT,OAAA;UAAGe,IAAI,EAAC,oBAAoB;UAACC,MAAM,EAAC,QAAQ;UAACC,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAW;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,KAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAClYd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAI;MAA4B;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrCd,OAAA;QAAAS,QAAA,eAAGT,OAAA;UAAAS,QAAA,EAAG;QAAY;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACjB,CAAC,eACVd,OAAA,CAACF,IAAI;MAACoB,EAAE,EAAC,GAAG;MAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;IAAI;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAM,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACZ,CAAC;AAErB;AAACZ,EAAA,CA5CQD,OAAO;AAAAkB,EAAA,GAAPlB,OAAO;AA8ChB,eAAeA,OAAO;AAAC,IAAAkB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
